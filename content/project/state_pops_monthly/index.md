A spinoff of the project "Bayesian Analysis of Mask Mandate Effectiveness." I created a minimalistic website with an interactive U.S. map that allowed users to download estimated month-to-month populations of any subset of states in the U.S.. Users could customize the states, the start and end dates, and the interpolation method. The outcome was a downloaded excel file that had an individual sheet for each state with the estimated population each month over the selected range.
