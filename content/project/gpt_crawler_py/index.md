A GPT knowledge file web crawler in base python. Inspired by Builder IO's [GPT Crawler](https://github.com/BuilderIO/gpt-crawler) and the [Python interpretation](https://github.com/A-baoYang/gpt-crawler-py) by A-baoYang, I decided to create my own version which is a bit lighter on prerequisites. Despite both of these being very accessible, installing any combination of node, chromium, and playwright can be a pain if your hosting provider does not support installing these dependencies. Therefore, I rewrote the project using only Python's os, requests, and beautifulsoup4 libraries.
